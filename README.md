<h1>Lagos State Flood Prediction 2024</h1>
<p>This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and predictive modelling effort aimed at forecasting potential flood events in Lagos State for the year 2024. The project uses historical weather data and machine learning techniques to predict flood occurrences.</p>
<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to predict future flood events in Lagos State using a dataset with various weather features. By analyzing patterns and trends in the data, we aim to provide early warnings and actionable insights to help mitigate the impact of floods.</p>
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>The dataset used in this project includes the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Datetime:</strong> The timestamp of the recorded weather data.</li>
<li><strong>Tempmax:</strong> Maximum temperature recorded.</li>
<li><strong>Tempmin:</strong> Minimum temperature recorded.</li>
<li><strong>Temp:</strong> Average temperature.</li>
<li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Humidity level.</li>
<li><strong>Precip:</strong> Total precipitation.</li>
<li><strong>Precipprob:</strong> Probability of precipitation.</li>
<li><strong>Precipcover:</strong> Coverage of precipitation.</li>
<li><strong>Preciptype:</strong> Type of precipitation (e.g., rain, snow).</li>
<li><strong>Windgust:</strong> Maximum wind gust speed.</li>
<li><strong>Windspeed:</strong> Average wind speed.</li>
<li><strong>Winddir:</strong> Wind direction.</li>
<li><strong>Sealevelpressure:</strong> Sea level pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Cloudcover:</strong> Cloud cover percentage.</li>
<li><strong>Severerisk:</strong> Risk level of severe weather.</li>
<li><strong>Moonphase:</strong> Phase of the moon.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Approach</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis. This includes handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature engineering.</li>
<li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong> Analyzing the data to understand patterns, trends, and correlations related to flooding events.</li>
<li><strong>Predictive Modeling:</strong> Using machine learning techniques to build predictive models that forecast potential flood events based on historical weather data.</li>
<li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to ensure reliable predictions.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Findings</h2>
<p>The analysis aims to uncover key patterns and indicators that could signal an increased risk of flooding. Insights from the data will be used to develop a predictive model that can forecast flood occurrences and provide early warnings.</p>
